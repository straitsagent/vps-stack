# Automation Stack Roadmap

**Last updated:** 2026-06-25 (full structural redraft — reframed around coherent portfolio advisor; Professional Intelligence deleted; dashboard + affection-bot split + ReAct sequencing added; reality-synced against live Windmill audit)
**Owner:** ${OWNER_NAME}

> **Architecture specs:** Full pseudocode for every workflow lives in [`WORKFLOW_ARCHITECTURE.md`](WORKFLOW_ARCHITECTURE.md).
> **Testing philosophy:** [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md). **Operations / runbooks:** [`OPERATIONS.md`](OPERATIONS.md).

---

## Objective

Build a personal **portfolio advisor** — a coherent system that tells you what to keep, what to cut, and what to buy next. It reasons across both **remove** and **add** decisions with quantitative precision, and delivers intelligence through two surfaces:

- **Push** — email digests, Telegram alerts, and proactive notifications from Windmill-scheduled scripts
- **Pull** — a web dashboard where you can navigate portfolio positions, research reports, news digests, and advisor outputs

The Telegram agent is the interactive front-end for the advisor — one component of the stack, not the organizing spine. Every workflow serves the portfolio advisor goal.

---

## Build Sequence

What gets built next, in priority order:

1. **Reality-sync + hygiene** — reconcile cron drift, split affection bot, decide empty-table fate (fast, low-risk — Part 5)
2. **Portfolio coherence seams** — idea pipeline → replacement screener → close the loop (the advisor's missing connective tissue — Part 2 A/B/C)
3. **Quantitative precision** — historical valuation percentiles, factor exposures, risk matrix, sizing math (Part 2D)
4. **Dashboard** — scaffold early (view existing data immediately); enrich as the advisor matures; parallelizable with 2+3 (Part 3)
5. **ReAct reasoning layer** — dynamic agent reasoning over the fully-wired advisor tools (Part 4)

---

## Part 1 — What's Running

Everything below is live and running unattended unless noted.

> **Schedules reconciled 2026-06-25** — git filenames now match live server paths; cron values verified. `earnings_post_check` canonicalized to 7 AM SGT; `price_fetcher` confirmed 7 days/week.

### Foundation

## Part 2 — The Coherent Portfolio Advisor

The centerpiece of the next build phase. The goal: a system that reasons across both **what to remove** and **what to add** — automatically, with quantitative grounding, without a human bridging each step.

### Current Data Flow

```
[YouTube / News scans]
     |
     |  ✗ no extraction — tickers/ideas evaporate
     ↓
[stock_data_fetcher] ─────────────→ [13 quant tables]

                         ✗ human supplies ticker          |
                                          ↓               ↓

                                          |
                               [portfolio_candidate_evals]
                                          |
                               ✗ terminal — nothing reads it
```

### The Three Broken Seams (all currently human-bridged)

| Seam | Problem | Initiative |
|---|---|---|
| **A. No idea pipeline** | YouTube + news scans never extract or store candidate tickers. Good ideas mentioned in scanned content evaporate. | Idea Pipeline |
| **B. No replacement screener** | `portfolio_rationalization` flags EXIT/TRIM but `replacement_ticker` column is filled by a human, not the system. Nothing searches for what to buy instead. | Replacement Screener |
| **C. Terminal verdicts** | `portfolio_candidate_evals` has ADD/WATCH/PASS verdicts. Nothing reads them. They accumulate but never feed back into the rationalization cycle or a watchlist. | Close the Loop |

---

### Initiative A — Idea Pipeline 🔲

**Goal:** Capture tickers and investment ideas from the YouTube monitor and morning news digest — automatically, without losing them to the scroll.

**Approach:**
- Post-processing LLM extraction pass on YouTube + news scan output (low-cost Deepseek call after each scan run)
- New DB table: `watchlist_ideas` (ticker, source, reason, added_at, status: `pending` / `evaluated` / `archived`)
- `candidate_eval` pull mode: periodically (or on-demand via Telegram) reads `pending` watchlist_ideas and evaluates them
- Generalises the existing auto-dispatch pattern already built into `candidate_eval` — minimal new code

---

### Initiative B — Replacement Screener 🔲

**Goal:** When `portfolio_rationalization` recommends EXIT/TRIM, automatically generate and rank candidate replacements — no human needed to supply a ticker.

**Approach:**
- On EXIT/TRIM signal: extract sector + factor profile of the flagged position from `portfolio_scores`
- Screener query: peers from `peer_comparisons` + expanded universe (ETF constituents, curated list) → filter by sector / factor match → rank by composite score
- Auto-populate `replacement_ticker` in `portfolio_scores` for the top-ranked candidate
- Auto-dispatch `candidate_eval` for the top candidate(s) — feeds into the same pipeline as Initiative A

---

### Initiative C — Close the Loop 🔲

**Goal:** `portfolio_candidate_evals` verdicts feed back into the advisor cycle rather than terminating there.

**Approach:**
- WATCH/ADD verdicts write to `watchlist_ideas` (status: `watchlist`)
- `watchlist_ideas` becomes the shared idea store — the output of A, B, and C all flows here
- Next rationalization run includes watchlist items in its narrative section ("monitored candidates")
- Dashboard (Part 3) exposes the watchlist as a navigable view

---

### Initiative D — Quantitative Precision 🔲

**Goal:** Improve the numeric quality of the advisor's scoring and recommendations. All four sub-items are solvable with data already in the DB.

**Current gaps:**

| Gap | Fix | New DB artifact |
|---|---|---|
| Only `beta` stored — no factor exposures (value/growth/momentum/quality) | Regress returns against Fama-French proxies from `price_history` | `factor_exposures` table |
| Valuation ranked cross-sectionally only — no per-ticker historical percentile | Compute from existing `financial_statements` history | `valuation_percentiles` table |
| No persisted correlation matrix or portfolio-level risk decomposition | Compute from `price_history` (33 positions, daily closes) | `risk_matrix` table |
| Position sizing is narrative (min/median/max) — no vol-target or risk-contribution math | Replace narrative with vol-target math (e.g. 1% daily vol per position); output as suggested weight range in rationalization | — (computed at scoring time) |

**Build order:** historical valuation percentiles → correlation/risk matrix → factor exposures → vol-target sizing.

---

## Part 3 — The Dashboard

A read-only web portal to navigate advisor outputs, portfolio positions, and research history. Parallelizable with Part 2 — Phase 1 (scaffold) immediately makes existing data navigable; Phases 2–4 enrich as the advisor matures.

### Architecture

- **Container:** Dedicated `dashboard` service in `/root/docker-compose.yml` — own image, joined to `agent_net` and `default` networks
- **Edge:** New route in `/opt/n8n/Caddyfile` proxying `https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/dash` (or similar) → `dashboard:3000`; auto-TLS via the existing public Caddy
- **Auth:** Token-based or HTTP Basic auth enforced at the Caddy layer — **net-new requirement, no unauthenticated public exposure**
- **Data (read-only):**
  - Postgres — read-only role (`portfolio_user`), 127.0.0.1:5432
  - `/research/` directory mount — `.md` files via `/root/research/index.json` manifest

### Views (phased)

| Phase | View | Data source |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Scaffold + auth | Login page + connectivity health | Auth layer; Postgres ping |
| 2 — Portfolio | Positions table, P&L, move history, scores | `portfolio_positions`, `price_history`, `portfolio_scores` |
| 3 — Research & news | Browse news / YouTube / macro / earnings digests chronologically | `/research/*.md` via `index.json` |
| 4 — Advisor outputs | Rationalization scorecard, candidate evals, watchlist, replacement candidates | `portfolio_scores`, `portfolio_candidate_evals`, `watchlist_ideas` |

**Status:** 🔲 Not started

---

## Part 4 — Agent Reasoning (ReAct)

The Telegram agent's dynamic reasoning layer. Sequenced **after** Parts 2–3 so it has a fully-wired, coherent set of advisor tools to reason over.

### What's Live — W4a Static Planner

`planner.py` generates linear tool sequences for `portfolio_analysis`, `thesis_check`, `macro_brief`. Sequential plan → execute → synthesise. No iteration, no feedback loops.

### W4b — Dynamic ReAct Loop 🔲

**What changes:** The `MULTI_STEP` branch gets an iteration controller. The LLM decides at runtime which tools to call, in what order, and when it has enough information to answer.

**Why sequence it here:** A ReAct loop today hits all three broken seams — no idea pipeline, no replacement candidates, terminal verdicts. After Parts 2–3, the same loop can answer "what should I be moving into instead of BABA?" end-to-end without human bridging.

**Architecture (medium change — not a rewrite):**
- Slots into existing `MULTI_STEP` branch in `main.py`
- Reuses all `FAST_EXECUTORS` as the tool interface (no new tool contracts)
- Adds: iteration controller, per-step token accounting, stopping condition (LLM emits `{"action": "final_answer", ...}` structure vs `{"action": "tool_call", ...}`)
- Max-steps guard (5 tool calls) to prevent runaway loops
- Reasoning model: Grok-4.3 (Deepseek handles classification only)

---

## Part 5 — Infrastructure & Hygiene

Fast, low-risk items. Run these before or in parallel with the main build sequence.

### Affection Bot Separation ✅ done (2026-06-26)

The hourly affection ping now runs on its own Telegram bot (`StraitsAffectionBot`) via `u/admin/affection_bot_token`. No code change — one schedule-arg edit live-verified with a one-off run. See `docs/logs/2026-06-26_affection-bot-split.md`.

### Schedule-Drift Reconciliation ✅ done (2026-06-25)

Resolved: see `docs/logs/2026-06-25_schedule-drift-reconcile.md`.

### Empty Table Decisions

| Table | Rows | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| `portfolio_thesis` | 0 | Keep — used by the `Thesis 10%` factor in rationalization scoring. Seed with a few entries via the `thesis_write` agent command, or auto-seed from `research_reports`. |
| `earnings_surprises` | 0 | Evaluate: does `earnings_analyses` supersede this? If so, leave empty or drop. Decide in a hygiene session. |

### Macro Daily Push — Formal Disposition

`macro_daily_push` and `macro_daily_push_telegram` exist as deployed scripts but the schedule is disabled. `macro_research` (7AM Mon–Fri) handles the macro push. Decision: remove the disabled schedule from Windmill, or formally document it as parked. Action in next hygiene session.

### API Health Monitor 🔲 (lower priority)

Weekly (Sunday evening). Tests all key external API endpoints. Logs to `api_health_log`. Emails on degradation. Reference: `docs/audit/260605_api_endpoint_full_audit.md`.

---

## Deleted / Parked

### Professional Intelligence — REMOVED

The APAC deal tracker, sponsor news monitor, and LNG spread alert have been **removed from the roadmap**. These were never built and are not relevant to the personal portfolio advisor focus.

Deleted items (will not be built):
- 5.1 APAC Infrastructure Deal Tracker (IJGlobal/PFI/Infralogic RSS)
- 5.2 Sponsor News Monitor (KKR, Actis, DigitalBridge, Macquarie, Stonepeak, Brookfield)
- 5.3 LNG Price & Spread Alert (JKM vs TTF + Henry Hub)

If professional intelligence becomes relevant again, start a new plan from scratch — do not restore these items.

### Productivity Workflows — Parked (low priority)

Revisit only after the portfolio advisor track is materially complete:
- Weekly Agenda Prep (Google Calendar → email, Sunday 7PM SGT)
- Chess Puzzle Reminder (daily 9PM SGT, Lichess link)
- Reading List Digest (Google Sheets → weekend digest, Friday 6PM SGT)
- LinkedIn Post Reminder (Monday 8AM SGT, topic from week's headlines)

### Other Parked Items

| Item | Why parked |
|---|---|
| F3 — Signal Collection | Superseded by Initiative A (structured idea extraction from scans) |
| F4 — Stock Idea Generator | Superseded by Initiatives A + B |
| Deep Stock Analysis / Buy-Hold Tool | Requires article scraping; some sources block. Revisit as standalone tool when needed |
| W5/W6 staging model (Persistent Memory / Portfolio Advisor Mode) | The W-series stage model served bootstrapping. These goals are now absorbed into the coherent advisor build (Parts 2–4) |
| W-Business — Business-Facing Agent | Not planned |
| WhatsApp transport | Switched to Telegram due to LID protocol issues. Revisit via hosted bridge if needed |
| Part 4 Agent Data Sources (old) | Earnings Surprise Tracker + Financial Statement Quarterly Pull are now handled by research_tool / stock_data_fetcher. Revisit as scheduled batch fetcher if gaps emerge |

### Telegram Formatter Architecture (md-driven)

Every Windmill notification uses a **canonical markdown → dedicated formatter** pattern:

1. **Main script** writes `/research/<type>/<date>.md`: JSON front-matter + ≥500-word narrative + `<!-- DETAIL -->` separator.
2. **`<name>_telegram.py` formatter** reads the `.md`, builds the ≥500-word self-contained Telegram message, sends via the shared sender, logs to `telegram_outbox`.

| Formatter Script | Main Script | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `u/admin/macro_daily_push_telegram` | `u/admin/macro_daily_push` | ⚠️ Main script disabled |
| `u/admin/portfolio_email_telegram` | `u/admin/portfolio_email` | ✅ Live |
| `u/admin/portfolio_review_telegram` | `u/admin/portfolio_review` | ✅ Live |
| `u/admin/portfolio_rationalization_telegram` | `u/admin/portfolio_rationalization` | ✅ Live |
